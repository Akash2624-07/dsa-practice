# 🚀 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to our collaborative **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This project is maintained by a group of learners committed to mastering DSA by solving and sharing problems together.  
It follows a contributor-based folder structure, and each contributor documents their progress topic-wise in their own subdirectory.

```

Each contributor maintains their own folders and adds a `README.md` inside each topic to log progress.

## 🛠️ How We Work

- ✅ Each contributor pushes their code in their own folder.
- ✅ Folder naming follows lowercase_topic_name convention.
- ✅ Solution files should be named clearly. Example: `kadanes_algorithm.cpp`, `01_knapsack.cpp`
- ✅ Each solution includes a brief explanation and time/space complexity if possible.
- ✅ `README.md` inside each topic folder is updated with solved problems and links.

## ✍️ Commit Style Guide

Use consistent and descriptive commit messages:

```
[topic] Solved <Problem Name> – <Your Name>
```
**Example:**  
`[arrays] Solved Two Sum – Akash`
