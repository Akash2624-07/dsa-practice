# 📘 Akash's DSA Journey

Welcome to my personal Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning archive.  
This repository documents my complete DSA preparation — from core concepts to problem solving — organized lecture-by-lecture and topic-wise.

Whether you're revising, learning along, or just exploring how to structure your own DSA journey, I hope you find this helpful!

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository

- Master core DSA topics through structured learning.
- Document concepts learned from video lectures.
- Solve related homework and online platform problems (LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces).
- Build a strong revision + portfolio resource.
